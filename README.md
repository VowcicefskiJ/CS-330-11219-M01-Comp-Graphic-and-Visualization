# 3D Scene and Design Decisions

## Overview

Welcome to my final project for the computational graphics and visualization course! This project showcases a 3D scene and the design decisions that went into creating it. The repository includes a ZIP folder of the 3D scene and a detailed Design Decisions document. Together, these components demonstrate my ability to create a fully realized 3D world using C++ and OpenGL.

## 3D Scene

The 3D scene features a simple fruit bowl on a wooden table. It includes a bowl, an apple, an orange, and a banana, all made from basic shapes like spheres and cylinders. I focused on making the textures and lighting look realistic while keeping the polygon count low to ensure efficiency.

## Design Decisions

The Design Decisions document dives into the choices I made during development. It covers everything from selecting the objects to applying textures and setting up lighting. It also explains how I organized my code into modular functions for better readability and maintenance.

## Reflection

### How do I approach designing software?

- **What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**
  This project helped me learn how to create low-polygon 3D models and apply high-resolution textures to make them look realistic. I also gained a deeper understanding of how to use lighting to enhance the visual appeal of a scene.
  
- **What design process did you follow for your project work?**
  I followed a step-by-step design process: first, I selected simple objects, then created the models, applied textures, set up the lighting, and finally organized the code into modular functions. Each step was planned to ensure a cohesive and efficient design.

- **How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**
  The tactics I used, such as modular code design, careful texture selection, and efficient polygon management, can be applied to future projects in game development, virtual reality, and simulation to create realistic and efficient 3D scenes.

### How do I approach developing programs?

- **What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**
  I used new strategies like the Phong shading model for realistic lighting and setting up a virtual camera for intuitive navigation. These strategies made the scene look better and easier to interact with.

- **How did iteration factor into your development?**
  Iteration was crucial in my development process. I continuously tested and refined the models, textures, lighting, and camera controls to get the desired outcome. Each iteration brought improvements and helped identify areas for further enhancement.

- **How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?**
  Throughout the milestones, I became better at organizing and modularizing my code. I learned to break down complex tasks into smaller functions, making the code easier to read, maintain, and extend.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

- **How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**
  Working on computational graphics and visualizations has given me a solid understanding of 3D modeling, texturing, and lighting. These skills are essential for advanced studies in computer graphics, game design, and virtual reality.

- **How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**
  The skills I gained, such as creating efficient 3D models, applying realistic textures, and setting up interactive environments, are valuable in professional fields like game development, animation, and simulation. These competencies will help me create immersive and visually appealing digital experiences.
